# Fraud-Analysis
The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a fraud detection system without relying on oversampling techniques like SMOTE or complex deep learning models. Instead, it utilizes traditional machine learning algorithms and effective feature engineering to achieve high accuracy and robustness.
